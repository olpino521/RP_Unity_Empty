-------------------------------PROTOTYPE 3------------------------------------------------

Empathize:
- Even if there are more enemies is the same because they fall towards me
- Since they are all the same size it's kinda boring
- I dont feel rewarded for killing the asteroids
- Felt relaxed because it didnt felt like there was any rush in destroying the asteroids

Define:

- The asteroids falling towards the player are boring, should change for something else
- The power ups are working but the player doesn't feel compeled to use them
- There is no rush into getting to get the winning score.

Ideate:

- Random size of asteroids
- Asteroids drop power ups
- A timer for the player to try and get a score for winning
- Asteroids come from the side so they become more like a block for shots for final boss 
and power up drop from destroyed asteroids
- Final boss
